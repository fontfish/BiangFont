# BiangFont
A very small font to provide display support for the Chinese character
“biáng”, both unsimplified and simplified.

Pre-made files can be found in the OTF directory.

## Variable Font
This font was a test for making variable fonts with Fontforge and Pilcrow.
As such, a variable font version is also available, allowing you to enjoy
noodles in a variety of weights!

A test of this is available
[here](https://fontfish.github.io/BiangFont/live-test/vf-test.html).

## 𰻞𰻞麵
Biangbiang noodles may be the food with the most difficult-to-write name
in the world, and the chinese character used to write the name of these
noodles has become widely known for its complexity (traditional: 𰻞,
simplified: 𰻝).

More information can be found on the
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biangbiang_noodles)
article.

## Notices
The BiangFont is a personal project and playground idea, so is liable to
be unorganised and no compatability or even usability testing is likely
to be carried out. The design remains rather rudimentary and is unlikely
to be seriously improved upon.

If you find yourself wishing that your favourite overcomplicated
hanzi/kanji would display in unicode text, however, this font may be of
use to you.
