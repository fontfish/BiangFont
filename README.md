# BiangFont
A very small font to provide display support for the Chinese character “biang2”, both unsimplified and simplified.

Pre-made files can be found in the OTF directory.

## Notices
The BiangFont is a personal project and playground idea, so is liable to be unorganised and no compatability or even usability testing is likely to be carried out.

If you find yourself wishing that your favourite overcomplicated hanzi/kanji would display in unicode text, however, this font may be of use.

## 𰻞𰻞麵
Biangbiang noodles may be the food with the most difficult-to-write name in the world, and the chinese character used to write the name of these noodles has become widely known for its complexity (traditional: 𰻞, simplified: 𰻝).
